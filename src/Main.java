                Hello and welcome to this lovely game called Tic Tac Toe.
                The goal of the game is for you to get three symbols in a row before
                your opponent. You get one move each per round.
                It is a tie if the field is totally cluttered with symbols without three of the
                same symbols in a row.
                First of all, please select one of the following by typing the corresponding number:
                1. Play against the computer. ðŸ’»
                2. Play local against a friend. ðŸ˜Ž

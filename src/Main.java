        Hello and welcome to this lovely game called Tic Tac Toe.
        The goal of the game is for you to get three symbols in a row before
        your opponent. You get one move each per round.
        It is a tie if the field is totally cluttered with symbols without three of the
        same symbols in a row.
        First of all, please select one of the following by typing the corresponding number:
        1. Play against the computer.
        2. Play local against a friend.
        3. Change the size of the board and how many rows of symbol that are required for a win.
